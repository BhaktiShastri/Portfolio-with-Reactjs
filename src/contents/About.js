                <p>I have started my journey in the world of computers not that long ago. 
                    I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from Pace University, New York. 
                    Web development is my center of interest. I am at the intermidiate stage of web-devlopment world.
                    I love the idea of cross-platform development, 1-n one code base deploy into almost
                    any platform, which web technology like Javascript enables me to do. I also like
                    creating Interactive UI components for better UX  and share those desgin and codes
                    to the world through Github. I really like to play around different framewroks.
